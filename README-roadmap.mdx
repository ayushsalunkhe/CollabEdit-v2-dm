# Online Collaborative IDE — Roadmap and Notes

This app follows the phases you outlined:
- Phase 1: Monaco Editor in the browser with React.
- Phase 2: Firebase setup with Firestore and Anonymous Auth (UI to paste client config in preview).
- Phase 3: Sessions: unique IDs, shareable links: `/session/{id}`.
- Phase 4: Real-time collaboration via Firestore onSnapshot + debounced updateDoc.
- Phase 5: Session-based chat with messages subcollection.
- Phase 6: Code execution via Judge0 (optional, needs server env: JUDGE0_API_KEY).
- Phase 7: Multi-file support (files map with add file UI).
- Phase 8: VS Code-like layout using shadcn/ui and Tailwind; presence counter.
- Phase 9: Security rules — set in Firebase console (dev is open; tighten before prod).

Deploy notes:
- Next.js App Router runs great on Vercel [^2]. React app setup aligns with current recommendations [^3].
- Set Firebase client config as NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars on Vercel, or paste locally on the home page.
- Set JUDGE0_API_KEY (and optionally JUDGE0_API_HOST) in Vercel Project Settings for code execution.
